## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud costs financial institutions billions annually. This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions using the **ULB Credit Card Fraud Dataset**. 

We tackle the extreme class imbalance (0.17% fraud) using **SMOTE** and compare two distinct architectures:
1. **Random Forest:** An ensemble method for robust tabular classification.
2. **Deep Neural Network (MLP):** A Keras-based model to capture complex non-linear patterns.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `data/`: Placeholder for the dataset (not uploaded due to size).
* `notebooks/`: Numbered Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and Modeling.
* `src/`: Reusable Python scripts for preprocessing.
* `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## 🚀 Key Concepts Covered
* **Imbalanced Data Handling:** SMOTE & Class Weighting.
* **Feature Engineering:** PCA interpretation and Robust Scaling.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** Precision-Recall Curves and AUPRC (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve).
